                <h1>About My Web Development Journey</h1>
                <h3>I started working in 2017 as a web development trainee for a logistics company in New Delhi. Here, I learnt the basics of web development and got acquianted with Django (a Python based framework). I, then grasped the concepts of Angular N+ and then moved on to basic CMSes like WordPress, Wix, and Magento.</h3>
                <h3>I soon realised that my future was in freelancing. It was not the flexible hours or the opportunity to work remotely that attracted me. As a freelance web developer, I get to choose the projects. This way, I get the opportunity to work on designs and tools that inspire me and keep me excited about my job. </h3>
                <h3>The personal touch that freelancing gives me is unparalleled. I simply love working with my clients â€” learning more about their industry and their backgrounds. My clientele hails from basically everywhere! India, USA, the Middle East, Australia, and so on.</h3>
                <h3>Well, let's get in touch. <a href=""><span class="link-text">Here I am -></span></a></h3>
